    <p class="drive">I want to learn about traffic more quickly as a customer. 
        I would like to see a map of my destination and receive 
        real-time, accurate traffic information. To ensure easy a
        ccess in the future, I would also like to store my most frequently 
        visited locations. Additionally, I want to be notified on my phone of any accidents or traffic jams. I want to adjust my schedule as needed, basing it on up-to-date information when planning my vacation. Furthermore, I would like offline access to maps and route data.
